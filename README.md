# PAT_Preduction
Project Overview
This research project focuses on predictive modeling and financial forecasting to better understand and optimize stock portfolios. Our work explores innovative applications of machine learning and financial analysis to derive insights from historical data, focusing on the correlation between guidance numbers and key metrics like Profit After Tax (PAT). This repository showcases each phase of the project, including model development, testing, and visualization.

Key Research Phases
Future Stock Price Prediction, Visualization, and Insights

This phase includes data preprocessing, merging various datasets, and conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis.
Models used: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series prediction.
Visualizations for trend analysis and stock performance ranking.
Guidance Numbers Extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs)

Utilization of LLMs for extracting critical financial guidance metrics from textual data sources to enhance forecasting accuracy.
Machine Learning for Financial Forecasting and PAT Prediction

We develop multiple regression models and compare their effectiveness in PAT prediction, using historical data over the past decade.
